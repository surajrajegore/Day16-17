A specific kind of word play traditionally called paronomasia, or more currently called a paragram,
changes one or more letters of a word or expression to create humor or irony or,
Collins (2004) suggests, to achieve 'dramatic, critical--or bathetic--effect' (p. 129).
Thus, Swan Lake becomes Swine Lake in a Marshall book (1999) about pigs performing a ballet;
a chapter on grammar in electronic communication in Woe Is I (O'Conner, 2003) is titled 'E-mail Intuition';
and Lars Anderson (2005) uses a paragram in the title of a Sports Illustrated article about exercise programs for NASCAR pit crews with
'Making a Fit Stop.' Once they're aware of paragrams, students will find them everywhere.
